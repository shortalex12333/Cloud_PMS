## Brand Values

### CelesteOS — Values, Behaviors, and Non-Negotiables (Canonical)

### Purpose

This document defines the values that **govern product decisions** and **shape how CelesteOS behaves**.

These are not aspirational words.
They are **operational constraints**.

If a feature, design, or message violates any value below, it is rejected.

---

# 1) The Brand Pairing (the one thing we stand for)

CelesteOS is deliberately paired with:

> **Calm authority under pressure.**
> “This system is defensible.”

Everything else is subordinate.

If Celeste ever feels:

* clever
* friendly
* impressive
* performative
* “AI-powered”

…we are off brand.

---

# 2) Core Values (what we optimise for)

## Value 1 — Defensibility

### Meaning

CelesteOS must make decisions and actions **provable**.

### Behaviors

* show sources (manual pages, revisions, history)
* preview every mutation as a clear diff
* record who did what, when, and how
* treat records as immutable facts

### Never do

* claims without evidence
* “trust us” language
* hidden changes

---

## Value 2 — Human Control

### Meaning

Celeste proposes. Humans decide. Always.

### Behaviors

* microactions are options, not commands
* no auto-execution
* no background actions that change state
* cancel is always safe

### Never do

* “we went ahead and…”
* one-click bulk changes
* silent automation “for convenience”

---

## Value 3 — Restraint

### Meaning

CelesteOS earns premium status by refusing to perform.

### Behaviors

* quiet UI
* minimal copy
* no tutorials in the interface
* no persuasion

### Never do

* hype language
* novelty UX
* “AI theater”
* delight animations

---

## Value 4 — Evidence Over Explanation

### Meaning

We do not justify. We show.

### Behaviors

* source citations
* diffs before changes
* live status lines
* visible uncertainty

### Never do

* “Why we think this”
* long assistant explanations in UI
* confidence theatre

---

## Value 5 — Honest Uncertainty

### Meaning

Uncertainty is shown, structured, and left to the user.

### Behaviors

* present multiple interpretations when needed
* order by confidence
* never guess
* never collapse ambiguity silently

### Never do

* forced single answers
* default selections that imply certainty
* executing based on “best guess”

---

## Value 6 — Calm Under Stress

### Meaning

CelesteOS is designed for fatigue, pressure, and incidents.

### Behaviors

* predictable behavior
* minimal steps for READ actions
* deliberate ritual for MUTATE actions
* no emotional language

### Never do

* cheerful tone
* urgency theatrics
* noisy visuals

---

# 3) Replacement Principle (our product stance)

CelesteOS is not a companion tool.

CelesteOS is designed to **replace** traditional yacht management work surfaces (IDEA / AMOS / VOLY) by absorbing their data and becoming the place work happens.

Legacy platforms may remain as:

* migration sources
* export targets (if required by owners/class/insurers)
* historical archives

But the operating goal is **one system**: CelesteOS.

If a decision forces users back into legacy modules, it violates this value.

---

# 4) Anticipation Without Automation (hidden strength, strict rules)

CelesteOS may anticipate what the user is working on and propose the next step.

Examples:

* “Generator high level alarm again” → “Add to handover draft?”
* “Find XYZ part” (out of stock) → “Draft supplier email with last order details?”
* “Hours of work” → “Prepare entry for review?”

Rules:

* Celeste never executes by default
* drafting is allowed and clearly marked as not committed
* publishing/submitting requires Preview → Sign → Commit → Record

This is how we reduce cognitive load without removing accountability.

---

# 5) Data Moat (internal truth, external posture)

Internally, CelesteOS captures high-value “data exhaust” from real work:

* recurring symptoms
* true resolution paths
* parts sourcing history
* vessel-specific patterns vs normal behavior
* equipment underperformance signatures

Externally, we do not talk about “learning from your data.”

We say:

> “Celeste becomes more useful over time because it accumulates evidence.”

We never frame this as AI magic.
We frame it as accumulated operational truth.

---

# 6) Language Values (how we speak)

CelesteOS speaks with:

* short factual sentences
* present tense
* technical nouns
* no persuasion

Allowed:

* “Add to handover draft?”
* “Manual section 4.2”
* “Last ordered: Oct 2025 — Supplier: X”
* “No changes were made.”

Banned:

* “AI-powered”
* “seamless”
* “don’t worry”
* “I think”
* “I recommend”
* “almost there”

---

# 7) Visual Values (how we look)

CelesteOS uses:

* black and white for seriousness and clarity
* blue for operational focus only

Colour is a signal of state, not personality.

No decorative gradients inside the product UI.
No icons as branding.
No motifs.

If the UI looks like SaaS, it violates brand values.

---

# 8) Decision Gate (how values enforce reality)

Before shipping any change, ask:

1. Does this increase defensibility?
2. Does this preserve human control?
3. Does it reduce cognitive load under pressure?
4. Does it avoid hype and performance?
5. Does it keep Celeste as the one work surface?

If any answer is “no”, reject.
