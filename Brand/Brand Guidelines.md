Brand Guidelines
CelesteOS — Brand System & Rules (Canonical)
Purpose

This document defines how CelesteOS presents itself in the world — visually, verbally, and behaviorally — so the brand remains consistent as the team scales.

If anything here is violated, it gets removed or rewritten.
CelesteOS wins through restraint. Drift is the enemy.

1) Brand Definition

A brand is not what we claim.
A brand is what people repeat about us after using us.

For CelesteOS, the intended gut feeling is:

Calm authority under pressure.
“This system doesn’t perform. It just works — and it’s defensible.”

If people describe CelesteOS as:

“cool”

“smart”

“AI-powered”

“modern”

“friendly”

…we are off-brand.

If they describe it as:

“serious”

“trustworthy”

“quiet”

“clear”

“the place we go when it matters”

…we are on-brand.

2) Category & Positioning
Category (what we are)

CelesteOS is a Maritime Engineering System of Record delivered through one universal search interface.

CelesteOS replaces traditional management software as the work surface by absorbing:

manuals, drawings, PDFs, photos

inventory, work orders, faults, notes

emails, handovers, historical logs

legacy exports (IDEA / AMOS / VOLY)

Those tools become data sources, not places people work.

What we are not

CelesteOS is not:

a chatbot

a dashboard product

“AI software”

generic SaaS

“an overlay” on top of PMS

Positioning statement (internal)

CelesteOS is the place engineering work happens.
Search → evidence → action → signed record.

3) Who We’re For
Primary users

Chief Engineers

Engineers / ETO

Technical captains

Fleet / yacht managers

Shipyard project managers (refit windows)

The identity we reinforce

“I’m accountable. I need to be right. I need proof.”

What they hate (important)

systems that guess

hidden state changes

cheerful software in serious moments

“smart” automation that surprises them

UI that feels like a demo

jargon and hype

CelesteOS must feel like an instrument, not an app.

4) Core Brand Pairing (the “Coke = yum” equivalent)

Branding is pairing a name with an emotion.

CelesteOS is paired with:

Defensibility.
“I can justify what I did and why.”

Everything must reinforce this:

the UI shows sources, not claims

actions are explicit, not assumed

changes are signed, not hidden

records are immutable, not editable

5) Brand Mood

CelesteOS mood is:

quiet

neutral

controlled

serious

unemotional

Not:

luxury

playful

warm

futuristic

“AI magic”

Control room at sea, not lifestyle tech.

6) Verbal Identity (copy rules)
What we say (allowed language)

evidence

records

sources

history

draft

sign

commit

logged

verified

manual section / revision / page

What we never say (banned)

AI-powered

smart assistant

seamless

leverage

automate

next-gen

we think / we believe

don’t worry

almost there

trust us

How we offer next steps (anticipation without automation)

CelesteOS may propose a next step as a short, neutral yes/no offer:

Allowed examples:

“Add to handover draft?”

“Draft supplier email?”

“Attach last order details?”

“Prepare hours entry for review?”

Not allowed:

“I’ve added this…”

“I recommend…”

“I went ahead and…”

7) Visual Identity System
7.1 Color palette (surface-level)

We use Black, White, Blue.

Black = seriousness / permanence
White = clarity / truth
Blue = operational focus (selection, verified state)

Color is functional. Not expressive.

Neutrals (primary)

White: #FFFFFF, #FAFAFA, #F8F8F0, #F4F4F4

Black: #020202, #181818, #242424

Blue (functional accent only)

#0070FF (focus/selection)

#00A4FF (secondary focus)

#BADDE9 (soft state tint)

Gradient (restricted brand-only)

#BADDE9 → #2FB9E8

Allowed:

website hero

launch materials

physical collateral

Forbidden:

product UI backgrounds

buttons

cards

microactions

If gradient appears inside the product, it’s a violation.

7.2 Logo rules

The logo must signal:

engineered restraint

symmetry

stability

instrument-like precision

It must never signal:

“brain”

“thinking”

“AI”

Usage:

entry points (login, splash)

marketing headers

document covers

Never used as:

UI decoration

background motif

repeated stamp

icon set substitute

Animation:

allowed: subtle fade-in once

forbidden: pulse, spin, morph, loop

7.3 Typography

Typography should feel:

modern but timeless

technical but calm

readable under fatigue

Approved type system:

Eloquia Display (headlines only)

Eloquia Text (body, UI, tables)

Rules:

no playful fonts

no “tech mono aesthetic” as branding

UI must prioritize legibility over style

8) UI Behavioral Branding (the part most brands miss)

CelesteOS brand is expressed through behavior more than visuals.

Behavior rules (non-negotiable)

Celeste never acts on its own

uncertainty is shown, not collapsed

mutations require: preview → sign → commit → record

no silent success

no hidden side effects

no dashboards as primary UI

microactions stay adjacent to what they affect

If UX violates these, the brand fails — even if the design looks good.

9) Messaging Hierarchy

We do not lead with features. We lead with reality.

Lead message (what they feel)

“This system is calm and defensible.”

Support message (what it does)

Search the entire boat

Show the evidence

Offer the next step

Record what happened with signatures

Proof (what convinces them)

source citations (manual pages, revisions)

immutable records

audit trail

repeat usage under pressure

10) What Success Looks Like

A Chief Engineer says:

“This is where we work now.”

Not:

“This tool is cool.”

The brand succeeds when:

Celeste becomes habit

Celeste becomes the system of record

legacy tools become irrelevant surfaces
