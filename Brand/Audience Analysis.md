## Audience Analysis

### CelesteOS — Who We Serve, What They Need, What They Hate (Canonical)

### Purpose

This document defines the real audiences for CelesteOS and the buying dynamics in yacht engineering and related operations.

It exists to prevent:

* building for the wrong user
* selling to the wrong buyer
* drifting into generic SaaS “pain points”
* mistaking “owners” or “admins” as the core customer

CelesteOS is built for **accountable professionals under pressure**.

---

# 1) The Market Reality (how yachts actually operate)

Yacht operations are not “office workflows.” They are:

* time-sensitive
* regulated
* multi-person accountable
* high cost of mistakes
* high crew turnover
* fragmented information sources

In reality, the current operating system onboard is:

* PDFs and manuals on NAS
* photos of parts and serial plates
* WhatsApp and email threads
* informal “knowledge in heads”
* legacy PMS systems used inconsistently
* handwritten notes and spreadsheets

The key behavior truth:

> **Under pressure, people bypass structured software.**
> They revert to whatever gives fastest clarity: memory, PDFs, messages.

CelesteOS exists to replace that chaos with:

* one universal search bar
* evidence-first answers
* safe actions
* signed records

---

# 2) The Primary Audience (the ones who create daily truth)

## A. Chief Engineer (Core User + Core Champion)

### What they do

* run systems
* diagnose faults
* manage inventory and maintenance reality
* carry responsibility when something fails

### What they need from CelesteOS

* fast orientation (“what’s happening?”)
* evidence (“show me the manual page / history”)
* confidence without theater (“prove it”)
* easy logging without admin overhead
* auditability for blame-proofing

### What they hate

* AI that guesses
* dashboards that don’t help at 2am
* software that needs training
* forms that slow action
* hidden changes

### Why they will adopt CelesteOS

Because it becomes the default place they go to:

* check inventory
* find notes and drawings
* log faults and work
* build handovers
* sign hours / submit records

**Celeste replaces the need to “go into IDEA/AMOS/VOLY”** by absorbing the data and owning the work surface.

---

## B. Second Engineer / ETO / Watchkeepers (Daily Operators)

### What they do

* execute work orders
* troubleshoot alarms
* maintain systems
* record daily work (often late, often incomplete)

### What they need

* search-first access
* clear “what can I do now?”
* minimal friction to log work in the moment
* safe guardrails for mutations

### Why they adopt

Because Celeste makes recording work **as you do it**, not after:

* “Add to handover draft?”
* “Prepare hours entry for review?”
* “Log this fault to history?”

This is the bridge from “work happens” → “record exists” without forcing modules.

---

# 3) The Offboard Audience (buyers, renewals, oversight)

## C. Yacht Management Companies / Fleet Technical Managers (Economic Buyer)

### What they care about

* risk reduction
* maintenance continuity despite crew changes
* defensible records
* fewer vendor emergencies
* predictable spend
* insurance/class readiness

### What they need from Celeste

* evidence trails
* vessel-level patterns over time
* exportable logs when required
* confidence that Celeste is the system of record

### What they hate

* “AI platform” language
* tools that create liability
* systems that can’t prove what happened

They renew if Celeste becomes:

* habitual onboard
* reliable during incidents
* provably useful in audits/refits

---

## D. Shipyard Project Managers (Refit / Yard Period Buyers)

### What they care about

* speed of diagnosis
* fewer delays due to missing info
* clear equipment history
* parts sourcing continuity
* reduced back-and-forth with crew

### What they need from Celeste

* instant retrieval of manuals/drawings/history
* last-known supplier details
* clear fault repetition patterns
* the ability to produce a defensible narrative of work done

Shipyards adopt Celeste when it prevents:

* “we can’t find the drawing”
* “we don’t know what was done last time”
* “we ordered the wrong part”

---

# 4) Secondary Audiences (not core, but affected)

## E. Captain (Operational Accountability)

They care about:

* reduced risk
* inspection readiness
* calmer operations
* confidence that engineering has control

Celeste helps captains by:

* making status defensible
* reducing ambiguity
* improving handovers and continuity

But captains are not the primary daily user.

---

## F. Owners (Not our product audience)

Owners may influence purchasing, but they are not the operating user.

If the product starts being designed to impress owners:

* it will become performative
* it will drift into dashboards
* it will lose engineers

Owners get value indirectly through reduced failures and better continuity.

---

# 5) Adoption Dynamics (how this actually spreads onboard)

Celeste adoption does not spread through “training.”

It spreads when:

* the first time someone is under pressure, Celeste gives them clarity
* Celeste shows the exact manual section
* Celeste shows the last time the fault happened
* Celeste proposes the next step without taking control
* the system captures a record without admin pain

That creates the internal narrative:

> “Just use Celeste.”

---

# 6) Emotional Drivers (the real buying psychology)

For this market, premium is not aspiration.

Premium is:

* **trust**
* **restraint**
* **defensibility**
* **accountability**

The core emotional outcome is:

> “I’m not going to get caught out.”

---

# 7) What They Hate (explicit list)

This list is critical. It defines brand boundaries.

They hate:

* surprises
* silent updates
* friendly “assistant” tone
* AI guessing
* “smart recommendations” that commit
* SaaS dashboards during real work
* systems that require perfect process adherence
* anything that creates audit risk

If Celeste triggers those feelings, adoption collapses.

---

# 8) The Celeste Advantage (replacement logic)

Celeste replaces legacy PMS work surfaces because:

* it accepts messy input
* it works under pressure
* it makes records unavoidable without being annoying
* it provides evidence instead of forcing workflow obedience
* it anticipates next steps without automating them

Legacy systems become:

* migration sources
* export targets (if required)
* historical archives

Not the place humans operate.

---

# 9) The Hidden Weapon (data moat) — internal only

Celeste captures **behavioral reality**, not just final states.

This produces a moat:

* recurring symptoms before failures
* true resolution paths
* parts out-of-stock patterns
* vessel-specific vs fleet-normal behavior
* equipment underperformance signatures

This improves predictive accuracy over time.

Externally, we never call this “AI learning.”
We describe it as:

> “Celeste becomes more useful over time because it accumulates evidence.”

---

# 10) Audience Summary Table (for internal alignment)

**Core daily user:** Chief Engineer / Engineer
**Primary buyer:** Yacht manager / fleet technical manager
**Expansion buyer:** Shipyards during refit windows
**Influencer:** Captain
**Not the audience:** Owners (direct product design)
