1. FIX SOMETHING (Fault → Diagnostic → Action)
Purpose:

Understand a problem → know what to do → take action fast.

What users actually want:

“What is this fault?”

“How bad is it?”

“What caused it?”

“What do I do next?”

“What parts do we need?”

“Has this happened before?”

“Should I tell the Chief/Captain/Management?”

Micro-actions in this cluster serve:

Diagnose fault

Open correct manual section

Show equipment history

Suggest likely parts

Create work order

Add to handover

Add photo/note

View related documents

Environmental variations:

At sea: urgency, motion, limited time

At port: more time, more options

Shipyard: deeper investigation, planning

Guest trip: instant clarity, minimal disruption

Night mode / silent mode: fast, low-interaction guidance

Why they need it:

To reduce downtime, risk, and embarrassment.

2. DO MAINTENANCE (Planned Work)
Purpose:

Stay ahead of scheduled tasks and avoid escalations.

What users actually want:

“What is due today?”

“What can I do right now?”

“What’s coming up this week?”

“What’s overdue?”

“Where’s the checklist/manual for this task?”

Micro-actions serve:

Create WO

Mark WO complete

Add note/photo

Auto-fill WO with manual info

Add parts

Add to handover

Show history

Environmental variations:

At anchor: time available — backlog work

At sea: only safe tasks

Guest mode: minimize interference

Port: catch-up tasks

Shipyard: mass maintenance with contractors

Why they need it:

To avoid being behind on PMS and prevent faults.

3. MANAGE EQUIPMENT (Asset Intelligence)
Purpose:

Understand the state and context of a system at any time.

What users want:

“Show me everything about this piece of equipment.”

“What’s its maintenance history?”

“What parts does it use?”

“What's its current condition?”

“Where is it located?”

“What fails most often?”

Micro-actions serve:

View equipment

View history

Open manuals

Show parts

Predictive insights

Add note

Add to handover

Environmental variations:

Chief engineer: macro-level view

New ETO/engineer: system orientation

Audit: proof of maintenance history

Shipyard: planning replacements

Why they need it:

To maintain situational awareness and reduce blind spots.

4. CONTROL INVENTORY & PARTS
Purpose:

Ensure you have the right spares, don’t run out, don’t waste money, and know what part fits what equipment.

Users want:

“Do we have this part onboard?”

“Where is it stored?”

“How many left?”

“Has this part been used recently?”

“Order more filters.”

“Which part fixes this fault?”

Micro-actions serve:

View stock

Order part

Add part to handover

Add part to WO

Log usage

Compare supplier pricing

Environmental variations:

Guest trip: critical parts needed urgently

Shipyard: bulk ordering

At sea: check if replacement is available

Port: restock opportunity

Why they need it:

To stay self-sufficient and avoid delays.

5. COMMUNICATE STATUS (Handover, Notes, Reports)
Purpose:

Transfer knowledge quickly, clearly, and consistently between crew and management.

Users want:

“Add this to handover.”

“What do I need to tell the next engineer?”

“Summarize this week.”

“Send update to management.”

“Attach this manual section to the handover.”

Micro-actions serve:

Add to handover

Edit handover section

Export handover

Add note

Add predictive insight

Add document

Generate summary

Auto-describe fault/work

Environmental variations:

Crew change: major handover creation

Shipyard: daily contractor updates

Management trips: weekly report

Audit: structured evidence

Emergencies: quick log for after-action review

Why they need it:

To ensure continuity and reduce chaos in transitions.

6. COMPLY & PREPARE FOR AUDIT
Purpose:

Maintain compliance with class, flag, ISM, MLC, and avoid fines or detention.

Users want:

“Show missing certificates.”

“What expires soon?”

“Does our hours of rest violate MLC?”

“Generate audit pack.”

“Show logs for last 3 months.”

Micro-actions serve:

View certificate

Log HOR

Correct HOR entry

Export logs

Generate pack

Add corrective action

Environmental variations:

Pre-audit scramble: urgent fixes

Mid-season: low priority

Shipyard: major certificate updates

Why they need it:

Avoid failing inspections or damaging reputation.

7. PROCURE, TRACK, AND MANAGE SUPPLIERS
Purpose:

Acquire parts and services efficiently.

Users want:

“Order two MTU filters.”

“Track this delivery.”

“Add invoice to PO.”

“What was last year’s price?”

Micro-actions:

Create purchase request

Add part to PO

Approve PO

Log delivery

Attach invoice

Update order status

Environmental variations:

Port call: time-sensitive orders

Shipyard: contractor-heavy procurement

Management-run fleet: centralized approval workflows

Why they need it:

To reduce downtime, control cost, maintain correct inventory.

⭐ HOW TO USE THIS FEATURE CLUSTER MAP FOR DESIGN

This gives you the only 7 purposes engineering teams ever use a PMS for.

Your next steps:

Map each cluster → micro-actions

Delete unnecessary micro-actions

Merge overlapping intents

Design scenario-dependent variations
(e.g., “at sea” vs “shipyard” changes the parameters or risk rules, not the action.)

Attach context triggers
(equipment, fault, part, time, environment)

⭐ WHY MICRO-ACTIONS EXIST (THE PURPOSE BEHIND THEM)
Every micro-action must satisfy at least one of these:

Resolve uncertainty
(diagnose, show history, open manual)

Advance progress
(create WO, order part, close task)

Transfer information
(add to handover, add note, export)

Ensure continuity
(save evidence, link context, track usage)

Protect compliance
(log HOR, export logs, show expiry)

If a micro-action does not obviously fit one of these five purposes —
it’s a candidate for deletion.

⭐ HOW REQUESTS CHANGE ACROSS ENVIRONMENTS

Here’s the last component you asked for:
how the SAME request changes in different scenarios.

Example:

“Create a work order for stabilizer fault.”

At sea:
→ minimal fields, high urgency, warnings if unsafe.

At anchor:
→ more detail allowed, part usage suggestion.

Port:
→ can attach supplier request automatically.

Shipyard:
→ tagged as contractor task, long-term scheduling.

Guest trip:
→ optional “silent mode”: WO created quietly.
