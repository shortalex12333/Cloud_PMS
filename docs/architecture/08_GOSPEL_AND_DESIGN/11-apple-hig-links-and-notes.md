# Apple HIG: Search fields / Searching / Materials (links + distilled guidance)

## Distilled, practical guidance (based on Apple’s summaries + consistent HIG patterns)
### Search field anatomy
- Search icon + clear affordance
- Placeholder text that describes scope
- Immediate feedback (results update as you type) when appropriate

### Searching patterns
- Offer suggestions when there’s value (recent searches, top results, categories)
- Clearly separate sections (Top Hit vs Applications vs Files)
- Let keyboard navigation do almost everything (up/down, enter, esc)

### Materials
- Use materials to separate foreground controls from background content
- Keep contrast high enough for legibility
- Don’t stack too many translucent layers (it gets muddy)

## Fast “don’t do this” list (why clones look wrong)
- Thick borders
- Big drop shadows
- Over-rounded corners
- Busy backgrounds behind the palette
- Non-system icons and inconsistent stroke weights
