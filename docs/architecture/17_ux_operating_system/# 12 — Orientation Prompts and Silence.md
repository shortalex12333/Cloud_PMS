# CelesteOS — Linguistic Guidance (Prompt Examples)

## Why This Document Exists

Users do not fail because they lack features.  
They fail because they do not know **what kind of thing they are allowed to say**.

Prompt examples exist to solve **linguistic uncertainty**, not product discovery.

If this surface is misunderstood, Celeste becomes:
- instructional
- prescriptive
- pushy
- or “AI-y”

This document locks it down.

## What Prompt Examples Are

Prompt examples are:

- linguistic affordances
- permission cues
- scope signals

They answer one question only:

> “What *kind* of questions can I ask here?”

They are not:
- actions
- shortcuts
- recommendations
- suggestions
- CTAs

---

## What Prompt Examples Are NOT

Prompt examples must never:

- execute anything
- be clickable
- populate the search bar
- appear as buttons
- imply correctness
- imply priority
- imply expectation

If a user feels nudged, the design is wrong.

---

## Placement (Non-Negotiable)

Prompt examples appear:

- **beneath** the search bar
- **above** the interpretation strip (when present)
- **above** results

They never appear:
- inside the search bar
- as placeholders
- rotating or oscillating
- animated
- persistent during result inspection

The search bar remains silent and empty.

---

## Visual Treatment

Prompt examples must look like:
- neutral text
- secondary guidance
- non-interactive copy

They must NOT look like:
- pills
- buttons
- links
- tags
- commands

Cursor remains default.
No pointer.
No hover affordance that suggests action.

---

## Hover / Focus Behavior

Hover is allowed **only** to clarify purpose, not meaning.

On hover:
- subtle emphasis is permitted
- a single helper line may appear:

> “Examples of things you can ask”

Nothing else.

No tooltips.
No explanations.
No “why this matters”.

---

## Copy Rules (Hard)

Prompt examples must:

- be phrased as natural language
- avoid imperative tone
- avoid system vocabulary
- avoid verbs that imply execution

Allowed:
- “generator alarm history”
- “what did I change today”
- “where did we order this last time”

Not allowed:
- “create work order”
- “close task”
- “submit report”

Execution language belongs to microactions, not prompts.

---

## Lifecycle Rules

Prompt examples are **ephemeral**.

They appear:
- on first load
- when the search bar is empty
- when no interpretation is active

They disappear:
- immediately on typing
- when interpretation appears
- when results stream

They do not reappear mid-session unless the search bar is cleared.

---

## Relationship to Trust

Prompt examples must never:
- compensate for bad interpretation
- hide uncertainty
- steer users toward “safe” queries
- bias system usage

Their only job is to reduce the fear of asking the wrong thing.

---

## Failure Modes (Automatic Rejection)

Any change that:
- makes prompts interactive
- makes prompts executable
- embeds prompts inside the bar
- animates prompts
- uses prompts to guide behavior
- uses prompts to increase engagement

…is rejected.

Prompt examples exist to **get out of the way**, not to perform.

---

## Success Criteria

This surface is correct if:

- users ignore it after initial familiarity
- users do not reference it verbally
- users never describe it as “suggestions”
- users feel free to type anything

Silence is success.

---

## Final Lock

> **Prompt examples exist to remove fear, not to add direction.  
> Once fear is gone, they should disappear.**
