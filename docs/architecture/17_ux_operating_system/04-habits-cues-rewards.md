# CelesteOS — Habits, Cues, and Rewards

## Why This Document Exists

Most software teams misunderstand habits.

They optimise for:
- onboarding
- feature discovery
- speed of task initiation

Celeste’s real habit risk is **after the action**, not before it.

If users do not feel certainty after acting, the habit collapses — even if the system “worked”.

---

## The Actual Habit Problem Celeste Solves

On a vessel, work happens under:
- interruption
- fatigue
- partial information
- time pressure
- future accountability

The dominant user anxiety is not:
> “How do I do this?”

It is:
> “Did that count?”  
> “Can I prove it later?”  
> “Will this come back to bite me?”

Celeste’s habit loop must resolve that anxiety.

## The Celeste Habit Loop (Non-Negotiable)

### Cue
- uncertainty
- interruption
- pressure
- incomplete memory
- “have we seen this before?”

### Routine
- search
- clarify context
- inspect evidence
- choose an action
- explicitly commit (or decline)

### Reward
- proof exists
- action is logged
- attribution is clear
- memory is externalised
- future reconstruction is possible

This reward is **evidentiary**, not emotional.

## Why Legacy Rewards Fail

Traditional PMS rewards users with:
- green tiles
- checkmarks
- completion states
- visual neatness

These feel good but do not survive:
- audits
- incidents
- crew changes
- time gaps

They reward **appearance of completion**, not defensibility.

Celeste deliberately rejects this model.

---

## What a Celeste Reward Looks Like

After a mutation, Celeste must surface:

- what changed
- when it changed
- who changed it
- where it is recorded

Example:
> ✓ Inventory updated  
> Logged • Attributed • Included in handover

No celebration.
No colour explosion.
No disappearance.

The reward is **certainty**.

---

## Closure Is Mandatory

An action without closure is a broken habit loop.

Every committed action must produce:
- immediate confirmation
- durable trace
- later retrievability

An empty screen after completion is unacceptable.

---

## Habit Reinforcement Over Time

Celeste must reinforce habits through:
- reliable recall (“what did I do today?”)
- consistency of event language
- stable retrieval of past actions
- predictable confirmation rituals

Habits form when the system behaves the same way every time.

---

## What Celeste Must Never Reward

Celeste must not reward:
- speed for its own sake
- bypassing confirmation
- hiding complexity
- acting without evidence
- visual tidiness

Fast mistakes are worse than slow correctness.

---

## Failure Modes (Automatic Rejection)

Any design that:
- removes post-action confirmation
- relies on colour alone for completion
- hides committed actions
- makes proof difficult to retrieve
- optimises for “feels done” over “is provable”

…breaks the habit loop and must be rejected.

---

## Success Criteria

Celeste is correct when users:
- act without fear of forgetting
- trust that work is remembered
- rely on the system during uncertainty
- stop double-checking themselves

When users stop asking:
> “Did I log that?”

The habit has formed.

## Final Lock

> **Celeste does not train users to finish tasks.  
> Celeste trains users to trust outcomes.**
