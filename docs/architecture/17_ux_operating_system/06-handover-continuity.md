# CelesteOS — Handover as Continuity (Not Planning)

## Why This Document Exists

Handover is where most operational systems fail quietly.

Either:
- information is lost,
- context is stripped,
- or responsibility becomes ambiguous.

Celeste treats handover as **continuity of reality**, not a task surface.

---

## The Purpose of Handover

Handover exists to answer one question:

> **“What state is the vessel in right now, and why?”**

Not:
- what should be done
- who should do it
- when it should be finished


---

## What Handover Is

Handover is:
- a living draft
- auto-assembled from real actions
- explicitly editable by humans
- attributable
- exportable
- auditable

It is a **document**, not a workspace.

---

## What Handover Is Not

Handover is not:
- a task list
- a scheduler
- a progress tracker
- a performance report
- a planning board

If users plan future work inside handover, the design is wrong.

---

## Source of Truth

Handover content originates from:
- search interactions
- ledger mutation events
- explicit user additions

Nothing enters handover silently.

Celeste may **propose** additions.
Users must **accept** them.

---

## Automation Rules (Strict)

Celeste may:
- suggest adding an action to handover
- surface unresolved items
- group related context automatically

Celeste may not:
- publish handover automatically
- infer importance
- remove content without consent
- mark items as “done”

---

## Editing Rules

Users may:
- rephrase wording
- add missing context
- remove irrelevant items
- reorder for clarity

Edits must:
- preserve original attribution
- never erase underlying ledger events
- remain traceable

The ledger is immutable.
The handover is curated.

---

## Example (Correct Behavior)

User searches:
> “generator high level alarm”

Celeste:
- surfaces history
- suggests: “Add this to handover?”

User accepts.

Later:
- inventory update occurs
- Celeste suggests inclusion
- user declines

Both decisions are preserved.

---

## Export and Distribution

Handover must be:
- exportable in professional templates
- shareable via email or PDF
- readable outside Celeste
- traceable back to source events

This ensures continuity even if Celeste is unavailable.

---

## Relationship to the Ledger

Ledger:
- records events
- immutable
- factual

Handover:
- summarizes state
- editable
- narrative

One never replaces the other.

---

## Failure Modes (Automatic Rejection)

Any change that:
- turns handover into planning
- introduces task ownership
- adds completion states
- scores progress
- hides uncertainty

…is rejected.

---

## Success Criteria

Handover is correct if:
- a new crew member understands context quickly
- unresolved issues remain visible
- no critical knowledge is lost
- responsibility remains clear
- audits require minimal explanation

# NOTES: 
rather than print handover, have crew receive via notificaiton in their app/log in, then re-read, confirm, verify, edit text. save, print, semail.

make department group of domains within each rank as a basic start. thereofre add to ahdnover buttons cna change dynamically by isers input query entities extracted as wella s deportamtn role/rank for db saving.

if we can launch compelted workflow to suers before completion acecptance, how can we store this suapabse? push completion workflwo to storage, then coutner sign in "handvover" tbale with "accepted"? make security measures so crew are unable to pass handover to next person without signing off. present message "Celeste can make mistakes, it is your resposiblity to change and accept." or some legal jargon.

see file /16_handover_buckets.md for eahc role/department accordingly.

## Final Lock

> **The ledger records what happened.  
> The handover explains what matters.**

This document is canonical.
