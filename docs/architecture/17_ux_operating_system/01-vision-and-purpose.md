# CelesteOS — Vision, Purpose, and Non-Negotiables

## Why This Document Exists

This document exists to prevent drift.

Every UX decision, feature proposal, shortcut, or “just one small addition” must be judged against what is written here.  
If something conflicts with this document, it is rejected — even if it is convenient, familiar, or requested.

CelesteOS does not optimise for comfort.
It optimises for correctness under pressure.

## The Core Reality Celeste Is Built For

Celeste is used **during work**, not before or after it.

Most software assumes:
- calm conditions
- time to think
- full context
- complete memory

That assumption is false on yachts.

Celeste assumes:
- interruptions
- partial information
- fatigue
- handovers
- accountability
- future questioning

Celeste operates **while reality is still moving**.

---

## What Celeste Is (Precisely)

Celeste is an **operational interlocutor**.

An interlocutor:
- listens to intent
- understands context
- responds appropriately
- remembers what was said and done
- can be questioned later

Celeste is not:
- a dashboard
- a filing cabinet
- a task manager
- a chatbot
- a reporting tool

Celeste proposes.
Humans decide.
Celeste records.

## The Fundamental Distinction

Traditional PMS systems:
- record reality *after* it has settled
- reward completion visually
- rely on navigation and memory
- encourage backfilling

Celeste:
- records intent and action *as they happen*
- rewards with proof, not colour
- relies on search, not navigation
- captures reality before it decays

This distinction is not aesthetic.
It is legal, operational, and cultural.

## The Brand Is a Behaviour, Not a Message

Celeste’s brand is not what we say.

Celeste’s brand is what users say **after they’ve used it under pressure**.

If users describe Celeste as:
- “easy”
- “clean”
- “nice”
- “fast”

We have failed.

If users say:
- “Just ask Celeste”
- “It remembers”
- “You can prove it later”
- “It’s calm when things aren’t”

We are correct.

## The Single Sentence That Must Stay True

> Celeste does not teach users where things are.  
> Celeste teaches users that asking is safe.

Every UX decision must reinforce this.

---

## Success Criteria (Non-Negotiable)

Celeste is successful if:
- a user can reconstruct what happened days or months later
- a captain can verify without interrogation
- a handover survives crew change without loss
- uncertainty is visible, not hidden
- nothing important relies on memory alone

---

## Failure Modes (Automatic Rejection)

Any proposal that:
- adds a dashboard as a primary surface
- prioritises scanning over asking
- hides state changes
- infers intent or confidence
- scores, ranks, or judges people
- optimises for “looking complete” over being provable

…is rejected.

No exceptions.

---

## The Cost We Accept

Celeste imposes a transition cost:
- fewer visual cues
- less passive reassurance
- discomfort for users trained on legacy software

We accept this cost deliberately.

Familiarity is not a virtue if it preserves failure modes.

---

## Final Lock

Celeste exists to replace memory, not responsibility.

It does not make decisions easier.
It makes decisions **defensible**.

This document is canonical.
