# Folder Build Completion

All specification documents for `/18_handover_bucket` have been generated.

The handover system is now fully defined across:

- Principles
- Taxonomy
- Domain mapping
- Overlap rules
- Draft model
- Intent capture
- Generation pipeline
- Review and sign-off
- Export logic
- Database schema
- Storage layout
- Audit traceability
- Guardrails
- n8n parity
- Python job specs
- API endpoints
- Test cases

This folder now represents the **authoritative behavioral contract** for Celeste’s handover system.

Implementation must conform to these documents.
No additional handover logic should be introduced outside this specification.
