# Bucket Taxonomy

This document defines the **presentation buckets** used in Celeste handover reports.

Buckets exist for one reason:

**To keep handover documents visually consistent and familiar to crew.**

They are **not** the storage classification.  
They are **not** the domain system.  
They are **not** the relevance engine.

They are purely the **document grouping layer**.

---

## Design rule

Every handover document always renders the same top-level structure:

1. Command  
2. Engineering  
3. ETO / AV-IT  
4. Deck  
5. Interior  
6. Admin & Compliance  

If a section has no active entries, it is hidden.

This guarantees:

- uniform branding
- predictable document layout
- zero training requirement
- professional appearance

---

## Bucket definitions

### 1) Command

Synthesis layer.

Generated by Celeste from underlying entries.

Contains:

- Operational Risk State  
- Guest Experience State  
- Vessel Readiness State  

Never manually written.  
Always references source entries.

Audience: Captain, Yacht Manager.

---

### 2) Engineering

Mechanical and physical vessel systems.

Typical content:

- Propulsion
- Power generation
- Electrical distribution
- HVAC and refrigeration
- Plumbing and sanitation
- Fuel and lubrication
- Hydraulics
- Fire systems (equipment state)
- Machinery space conditions

Primary roles:

- Chief Engineer
- Engineering Watchkeepers

---

### 3) ETO / AV-IT

Electronic, network, and monitoring systems.

Typical content:

- Navigation electronics
- Networks and connectivity
- Guest AV and control systems
- CCTV and access control
- Monitoring and alarm routing
- Radio and GMDSS

Primary roles:

- ETO / AV-IT Officer

---

### 4) Deck

Exterior and seamanship operations.

Typical content:

- Deck machinery
- Mooring and anchoring
- Tenders and toys
- Exterior maintenance
- Bridge operational procedures
- On-deck safety issues

Primary roles:

- Bosun
- Deck team
- Captain (bridge ops)

---

### 5) Interior

Guest-facing hotel operations.

Typical content:

- Guest preferences
- Housekeeping and laundry
- Galley and food service constraints
- Interior inventory and consumables

Primary roles:

- Chief Stew
- Interior team

---

### 6) Admin & Compliance

Administrative, financial, and regulatory continuity.

Typical content:

- Compliance and certification
- Crew and HR
- Finance and accounting
- Procurement and logistics
- Port operations and agents
- Insurance and claims

Primary roles:

- Purser / Admin
- Yacht Manager (shore)
- Captain (compliance oversight)

---

## Overlap handling

A single operational issue may appear in one bucket, while still being relevant to another department internally.

Example:

A passerelle fault caused by control electronics:

- Stored domain: Deck Machinery  
- Contributing discipline: ETO / AV-IT  
- Presented bucket: Deck  

ETO still sees it through relevance bias.  
Document remains clean for crew reading.

---

## What users never see

Users never see:

- Domain codes  
- Subdomain codes  
- Risk tags  
- Role bias rules  

These exist only for:

- relevance ranking
- AI grouping
- conflict detection
- audit traceability

---

## Why this works

Buckets stay stable.

Domains can evolve.

AI can improve classification.

But the handover document **always looks the same**.

No drift.  
No “new category every season”.  
No “General Outstanding”.

---

## Non-negotiable

If future development attempts to:

- add new top-level buckets casually
- expose raw domains to users
- allow free-text bucket creation

It must be rejected.

Uniformity is a trust feature.
