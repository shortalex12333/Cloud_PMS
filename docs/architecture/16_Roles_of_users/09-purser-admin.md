## Role summary

The Purser / Admin is the vessel’s operational accountant, clerk, and quiet fixer of bureaucracy. They sit between shore management, onboard departments, suppliers, and compliance bodies. When paperwork, money, or permissions fail — operations stall. Their work is invisible when done well and painfully visible when not.

They are the yacht’s administrative memory.

## Primary responsibility

Maintain financial, contractual, and compliance continuity between vessel, shore management, and external entities.
They report ot the cpatina, hold a senoir role, adn the most land-based roel onboard, little to no maritime knwoledge. effectively admin at sea.

If they fail: invoices go unpaid, deliveries are delayed, crew contracts lapse, port clearances fail, or compliance exposure appears without warning.

## Daily reality

Their day is digital and fragmented.

* Processing invoices
* Tracking purchase orders
* Managing crew contracts and travel
* Handling port agent paperwork
* Managing vessel accounts and petty cash
* Filing compliance certificates
* Answering management queries
* Chasing missing documentation
* Supporting captain and chief stew

They live in:

* Email
* PDFs
* Spreadsheets
* Accounting portals
* Legacy yacht management systems
* WhatsApp and phone calls

Their private questions:

* Is this invoice legitimate?
* Did we already pay this last month?
* Is this certificate still valid?
* Did the last purser leave clean records or a mess?
* Has ABC department filed this order already?

## Decision horizon

Days to months.

* Daily: payments, documentation, crew logistics
* Weekly: reporting and reconciliations
* Monthly: budgets and management reporting
* Seasonal: audits, insurance, flag compliance

Mostly procedural, but high consequence when something is missed.

## Driving factors

* Keeping operations unblocked
* Financial accuracy
* Compliance safety
* Being trusted by management and captain
* Avoiding last-minute crises

## Success metrics (real, informal)

* No delayed payments
* No missing certificates
* Smooth port clearances
* Management doesn’t chase them
* Crew paid correctly and on time
* Audits pass without panic

## What they value

* Accurate records
* Traceable approval chains
* Fast retrieval of documents
* Clear status of payments
* Systems that reduce double entry

## What they are often misinformed about

* Whether onboard work was actually completed before invoicing
* Whether purchase orders match real deliveries
* True inventory receipts
* Which certificates are approaching expiry
* Context behind spend requests

## How legacy software fails them

* Splits financial, compliance, and operational data
* Requires manual cross-checking between systems
* Buries documents in inconsistent folder trees
* Provides no narrative context for transactions
* Makes retrieval slower than re-requesting documents
* Breaks continuity across crew rotations

## How Celeste should empower them

They should be able to ask:

* “Show all unpaid invoices over 30 days”
* “Which certificates expire next month?”
* “Has this supplier been used before?”
* “Was this part actually delivered?”
* “Summarise monthly spend anomalies”

Celeste should:

* Connect documents to operational reality
* Preserve approval and decision context
* Allow instant retrieval without folder knowledge
* Flag uncertainty or missing links
* Reduce repetitive cross-checking

## Search behavior profile

Language is:

* Administrative
* Financial
* Compliance-oriented

Examples:

* “Crew visa expiry dates”
* “Outstanding supplier payments”
* “Insurance certificate validity”
* “PO history for XYZ supplier”

They search for:

* Document status
* Financial traceability
* Expiry risk
* Supplier history

## Handover sensitivity

Critical.

Purser handovers often hide silent liabilities.

Must persist:

* Pending payments
* Disputed invoices
* Compliance deadlines
* Contract peculiarities
* Unresolved documentation gaps

If lost, problems surface weeks later — when they are hardest to fix.
