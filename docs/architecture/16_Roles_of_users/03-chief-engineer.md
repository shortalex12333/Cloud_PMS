## Role summary

The Chief Engineer is the keeper of mechanical truth onboard. They are responsible for a machine that cannot fail, crew who rotate, records that lie by omission, and systems that age faster than budgets allow. They live in a constant negotiation between perfection, practicality, and what can be achieved with the people and time available.

They do not just fix problems. They decide which problems are allowed to exist.

## Primary responsibility

Maintain the vessel’s technical systems in a safe, operable, and compliant state within budget and crew capability.

If they fail: breakdowns at sea, safety incidents, yard overruns, insurance exposure, or loss of captain and owner confidence.

Most failures begin as deferred tasks whose context was lost at handover.

## Daily reality

They start the day with incomplete truth.

* Review overnight watch notes
* Inspect the engine room
* Field interruptions from bridge, deck, interior
* Deal with contractors
* Order parts
* Justify costs to management
* Train junior engineers
* Prepare compliance records
* Fight unrealistic timelines
* Glued to the computer chasing emails, messages and coomunication.

They constantly juggle:

* Immediate faults
* Preventative maintenance
* Paper compliance
* Budget pressure
* Crew competence gaps
* Aging equipment

Their private questions:

* Is this system actually safe or just passing inspection?
* Do I trust last season’s records?
* Can this wait or will it bite us later?
* Do I have the right spares onboard?
* Will management back me if I escalate?

## Decision horizon

Minutes to years.

* Immediate: alarms, breakdowns, watchkeeper support
* Daily: task prioritisation
* Weekly: maintenance scheduling
* Seasonal: yard planning
* Long-term: lifecycle replacement strategy

They live in a constant tension between reactive firefighting and strategic debt management.

## Driving factors

* Safety of vessel and crew
* Technical reputation
* Pride in a clean engine room
* Avoiding embarrassment during inspections
* Staying ahead of failures
* Keeping captain’s trust
* Not blowing the budget

## Success metrics (real, informal)

* No unplanned blackouts or propulsion loss
* Smooth inspections with minimal findings
* Yard period finishes close to plan
* Watchkeepers don’t drown in chaos
* Captain trusts their risk calls
* Problems are fixed before guests notice
* Crew comptenancy and independance

## What they value

* Accurate records over pretty reports
* Time to do jobs properly
* Competent watchkeepers
* Reliable spares inventory
* Honest fault reporting
* Tools that reduce admin burden

## What they are often misinformed about

* Whether past maintenance was actually performed
* True condition of hidden systems
* Accuracy of inventory counts
* Real skill level of new crew
* Whether management understands technical risk

## How legacy software fails them

* Forces maintenance logging for compliance, not truth
* Encourages “close task to clear screen” behavior
* Makes it harder to find history than to redo work
* Requires deep navigation to locate manuals or records
* Treats every job as equal priority
* Breaks continuity at every crew change
* Doesn’t capture reasoning behind deferrals

## How Celeste should empower them

They should be able to ask:

* “Has this fault happened before?”
* “Show me the last time we worked on this pump”
* “What maintenance is overdue that actually matters?”
* “What did the previous chief engineer worry about?”
* “Which systems are living on borrowed time?”
* *predicitive metrics of system health*

Celeste should:

* Surface true operational history
* Link faults, parts, manuals, and work orders naturally
* Preserve rationale behind decisions
* Reduce logging friction
* Expose uncertainty instead of hiding it
* Let them work in language, not forms

## Search behavior profile

Language is:

* Technical
* Abbreviated
* System-based
* Sometimes emotional under stress

Examples:

* “Generator 2 lube oil pressure drops”
* “Where’s the steering pump spare?”
* “History of black water blockages”
* “What did we defer last yard?”

They search for:

* System history
* Fault recurrence
* Manuals and drawings
* Spare location
* Decision context

## Handover sensitivity

Critical.

Chief engineer handovers are where maintenance debt hides.

Must persist:

* Deferred jobs and why
* Known weak equipment
* Temporary fixes
* Missing spares
* Contractor relationships
* Unwritten tribal knowledge

If lost, the next chief repeats the same mistakes at greater cost.
