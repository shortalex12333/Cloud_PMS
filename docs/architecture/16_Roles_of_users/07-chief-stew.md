## Role summary

The Chief Stew runs the interior like a five-star hotel that never stops moving. They translate vague owner expectations into invisible service, manage a team that rotates constantly, and carry the emotional labor of guests, crew, and captain alike. Their success is measured by what owners reactions are.

They operate at the intersection of hospitality, logistics, psychology, and crisis management.

## Primary responsibility

Deliver flawless guest experience while maintaining interior operations, crew performance, and service standards.

If they fail: guest dissatisfaction, crew conflict, service breakdowns, or reputational damage with owners and charter brokers.

## Daily reality

Their day starts before guests wake and ends after guests sleep.

* Service planning
* Guest preference tracking
* Cabin checks
* Laundry oversight
* Table settings
* Provisioning coordination
* Crew scheduling
* Handling complaints quietly
* Training junior stews
* Liaising with captain

They live in constant context switching:

* A guest request mid-service
* A crew conflict in the pantry
* A broken coffee machine
* A last-minute themed dinner
* A laundry backlog

Their internal questions:

* What does this guest expect that they didn’t say?
* Is my team actually ready or pretending?
* Did the last crew leave real information or just files?
* Will the captain back me if I escalate?

## Decision horizon

Minutes to weeks.

* Immediate: guest interactions
* Daily: service flow and crew management
* Short-term: guest itinerary and events
* Seasonal: standards, inventory, refits

They are mostly reactive with short bursts of planning.

## Driving factors

* Guest satisfaction and tips
* Owner reputation
* Crew morale
* Professional pride
* Maintaining control under pressure
* Being seen as indispensable

## Success metrics (real, informal)

* Guests feel cared for without noticing effort
* No service breakdowns
* Crew respect and low turnover
* Captain trusts them completely
* Strong charter feedback
* Good references

## What they value

* Accurate guest preference memory
* Reliable inventory knowledge
* Discreet communication
* Systems that don’t slow service
* Confidence that nothing is forgotten

## What they are often misinformed about

* Actual stock levels
* Whether laundry or housekeeping tasks were done properly
* True guest history from previous trips
* Interior maintenance status
* What the last chief stew actually knew

## How legacy software fails them

* Buries guest preferences in forms
* Treats hospitality like maintenance logging
* Requires typing instead of living service
* Loses emotional context of guests
* Doesn’t help during live service
* Forces end-of-day admin when they’re exhausted

## How Celeste should empower them

They should be able to ask:

* “Guest 1 preferences summary”
* “Anything pending for tonight’s dinner?”
* “Inventory of champagne?”
* “Issues left by previous chief stew?”
* “Crew schedule gaps”
* stews HOR ( to view all department hours of rest)

Celeste should:

* Surface guest context instantly
* Preserve soft knowledge across seasons
* Reduce manual admin
* Keep service invisible and smooth
* Allow discreet use during live ops

## Search behavior profile

Language is:

* Guest-centric
* Service-focused
* Often informal

Examples:

* “Mrs. X wine preference”
* “Table setup for formal dinner”
* “Laundry backlog”
* “Spa booking status”

They search for:

* Guest memory
* Service details
* Inventory
* Team coordination

## Handover sensitivity

Extreme.

Chief stew turnover resets guest memory.

Must persist:

* Guest likes, dislikes, boundaries
* Service standards
* Team dynamics
* Supplier preferences
* What has already gone wrong

If lost, guests feel the reset immediately.
