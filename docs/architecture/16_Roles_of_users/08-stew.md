## Role summary

The Stew delivers the guest experience moment by moment. They are the ones who actually pour the drink, make the bed, set the table, and handle guest requests with a smile regardless of stress behind the scenes. They operate in close proximity to guests, with little room for mistakes and limited authority to fix underlying problems.

They are performance under observation.

## Primary responsibility

Provide daily interior service to guests and maintain interior cleanliness and order under direction of the chief stew.

If they fail: guests feel neglected, service appears sloppy, complaints arise, or the chief stew’s system breaks down.

## Daily reality

Their day is repetitive, fast, and emotionally demanding.

* Cabin cleaning
* Turn-down service
* Laundry handling
* Table service
* Drink preparation
* Guest requests
* Restocking pantries
* Polishing, folding, arranging

They receive tasks quickly and without explanation.

Their private questions:

* What does this guest expect?
* Is this how the chief wants it done?
* Am I going to be blamed for something I wasn’t told?
* Where is that item kept?

## Decision horizon

Minutes to hours.

* Immediate: guest requests
* Short-term: service flow
* Almost no strategic visibility

They are highly reactive.

## Driving factors

* Tips
* Guest praise
* Avoiding reprimand
* Building experience for better roles
* Team acceptance

## Success metrics (real, informal)

* Guests say thank you by name
* No complaints about cabins or service
* Chief stew doesn’t need to chase them
* Good charter feedback
* Contract renewal

## What they value

* Clear standards
* Knowing guest preferences
* Fair workload
* Quick answers
* Not being embarrassed in front of guests

## What they are often misinformed about

* Guest sensitivities
* Inventory availability
* Why certain service rituals exist
* What happened last trip
* How interior equipment works

## How legacy software fails them

* Expects them to input data after exhausting days
* Stores procedures in folders they never open
* Doesn’t help mid-service
* Treats service as checklists
* Offers no safe way to ask “basic” questions

## How Celeste should empower them

They should be able to ask:

* “How does guest 3 take coffee?”
* “Where is spare linen?”
* “Wine list for tonight?”
* “Table setting standard?”

Celeste should:

* Give immediate, simple answers
* Preserve service memory
* Reduce fear of asking questions
* Support quiet usage during service
* Speed up learning for new stews

## Search behavior profile

Language is:

* Simple
* Task-based
* Informal
* vague

Examples:

* “Guest tea preference”
* “Fold napkin style”
* “Mini bar stock”
* “Laundry procedure”

They search for:

* How-to guidance
* Guest details
* Locations
* Standards

## Handover sensitivity

High.

Stew turnover is constant.

Must persist:

* Guest preferences
* Interior routines
* Equipment quirks
* Stock locations

If lost, service quality drops immediately.
However relaiance on chief stew communication is inital onboarding for new crew. Chief stew = brains, stews = workers.
