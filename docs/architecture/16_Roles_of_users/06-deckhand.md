## Role summary

The Deckhand is the visible face of the yacht’s exterior operation. They are the hands that make arrivals smooth, tenders flawless, toys ready, and the yacht look immaculate. They operate under constant observation by guests, officers, and cameras — with little margin for error and limited context of the bigger plan.

They are judged instantly, often silently.

## Primary responsibility

Carry out deck operations and maintenance safely, efficiently, and professionally under direction of the bosun and officers.

If they fail: guest embarrassment, safety incidents, damaged equipment, or visible decline in yacht presentation.

## Daily reality

Their day is physical, repetitive, and frequently interrupted.

* Washdowns
* Polishing stainless
* Line handling
* Fender work
* Tender driving
* Toy setup
* Cleaning lockers
* Safety drills
* Assisting navigation watches

They often receive tasks without context:

* “Prepare the starboard tender.”
* “Set the beach club.”
* “Lines ready in 10 minutes.”

They adapt on the fly.

Their private questions:

* What’s happening next?
* Has this been done before and how?
* Is this safe or just tradition?
* Who do I ask without looking inexperienced?

## Decision horizon

Minutes to hours.

* Immediate: physical operations
* Short-term: task completion
* Little strategic visibility

They are almost entirely reactive.

## Driving factors

* Avoiding mistakes in front of guests
* Gaining trust of bosun and captain
* Building sea time and references
* Being seen as reliable
* Staying out of trouble

## Success metrics (real, informal)

* Tasks done without being chased
* No accidents
* Guests feel looked after
* Promotion to senior deckhand
* Good references

## What they value

* Clear instructions
* Knowing the plan
* Fair task distribution
* Good equipment
* Leaders who explain rather than shout

## What they are often misinformed about

* Why certain procedures exist
* Real safety risks
* What equipment is fragile or unreliable
* What happened on previous trips
* Guest expectations until last minute

## How legacy software fails them

* Assumes they sit at computers
* Puts procedures in hard-to-find folders
* Doesn’t help during live ops
* Treats deck work as checklists
* Offers no way to learn from past incidents

## How Celeste should empower them

They should be able to ask:

* “How do we rig this safely?”
* “Where are spare lines?”
* “What’s next after docking?”
* “Any safety notes on this tender?”

Celeste should:

* Give fast, simple answers
* Surface deck procedures in plain language
* Preserve incident lessons
* Reduce fear of asking “stupid” questions
* Help new crew get competent faster

## Search behavior profile

Language is:

* Simple
* Informal
* Task-based

Examples:

* “How to start seabob”
* “Spare mooring line locker”
* “Beach setup procedure”
* “Tender fueling rules”

They search for:

* How-to guidance
* Locations
* Safety rules
* Next steps

## Handover sensitivity

Medium.

Deckhand turnover is frequent.

Must persist:

* Current operational routines
* Temporary fixes
* Known hazards
* Guest preferences
* Equipment quirks

If lost, the bosun carries the burden — until something goes wrong.
