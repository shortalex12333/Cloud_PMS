Role summary

The Yacht Manager sits ashore holding the long thread of continuity that the vessel itself cannot. They translate ownership expectations into operational reality. They do not run the yacht day-to-day, but they are accountable when things quietly drift off course. Their job is less about control and more about keeping the moving parts aligned when crew rotate, budgets flex, and owners change their minds mid-season.

Primary responsibility

Maintain operational continuity and financial control across a constantly changing onboard environment. They are ultimately accountable for budget adherence, compliance, manning stability, and ensuring the captain has what is needed before problems become visible to ownership.

If they fail: costs creep silently, maintenance debt accumulates, compliance slips, crew churn increases, and the owner loses confidence — usually without a single dramatic event.

Daily reality

Their day is fragmented by messages, calls, and documents from multiple vessels, captains, suppliers, agents, and owners.

They live in:

Budget spreadsheets

Crew contracts and rotation calendars (alongside purser, hr)

Invoices and approvals

Insurance, compliance, flag state correspondence - all bigger picture stuff not jsut the local necessary per docking etc. this is alongside deck department seniors.

WhatsApp threads with captains

Email chains with suppliers/shipyard

PDF reports from legacy systems

They rarely have full context. They make decisions based on partial truth, time pressure, and trust in whoever is currently onboard. captian is their go to contact.

They are constantly asking:

Is this cost real or just badly explained?

Is this issue urgent or being escalated for convenience?

Did we already solve this last season?

Is the record accurate or just filled to close a task?

Decision horizon

Weeks to months.

They think in:

Annual budgets

Refit windows

Contract cycles

Insurance and compliance deadlines

Crew retention risk

They are mostly strategic, but pulled into reactive firefighting when onboard context collapses.

Driving factors

Owner satisfaction and confidence

Avoiding surprise costs

Keeping good captains and engineers

Avoiding compliance or insurance exposure

Reputation in a small industry where word travels fast

Success metrics (real, informal)

Owner never feels “out of the loop”

Budget variance is explainable, not mysterious

Captain does not constantly escalate emergencies

Good crew stay longer than average

Refit periods are planned, not chaotic

No unpleasant surprises at audit or insurance renewal

What they value

Clarity over detail

Early signal over perfect reports

Trustworthy summaries

Calm escalation instead of panic

Proof when approving money

Continuity across crew changes

What they are often misinformed about

Actual onboard state versus recorded state

Whether maintenance logs reflect reality or compliance theatre

True workload and fatigue of senior crew

Whether spare parts inventory is real or theoretical

Whether “closed” work orders mean solved problems

How legacy software fails them

Reports are technically complete but semantically useless

They must learn each vessel’s internal filing habits

Data exists, but retrieval requires knowing where to click

No distinction between important and trivial records

Handover periods create data discontinuity

They receive PDFs instead of operational truth

Systems assume they want dashboards — they want answers

How Celeste should empower them

Ask: “Summarise outstanding operational risks on Vessel X”

Ask: “Show unexplained budget variance this month”

Ask: “Has this fault occurred before on any managed vessel?”

Ask: “What did the previous chief engineer flag before leaving?”

Celeste should:

Collapse fragmented reports into narrative truth

Highlight uncertainty when records conflict

Preserve cross-season memory

Let them query without knowing system structure

Give confidence before approving spend

Search behavior profile

Language is:

Managerial

Financial

Outcome-focused

Often vague on technical specifics

Examples:

“Why is engineering budget high this month?”

“Any unresolved safety items?”

“What’s pending before Med season?”

“Is the captain flagging anything serious?”

They search for:

Summaries

Exceptions

Risk

Trends

Evidence to support decisions

Handover sensitivity

Critical.

They need:

Continuity across captain and chief engineer changes

Preservation of unresolved issues beyond personalities

Institutional memory that survives season turnover

What cannot be lost:

Open risks

Deferred maintenance rationale

Owner preferences

Past incident context

Supplier disputes history

If handover fails here, the entire management layer becomes rumor-driven.
