## **Total Crew Count**

**Typical 125m yacht:**
**45–60 crew**

If charter-heavy with spa, security, expedition gear → **up to 65**

If private-use only → **40–50**

---

## **Reality Check**

* Command chain is tight: Captain → Staff Captain → Chief Engineer → Chief Stew.
* Everything else reports upward through department heads.
* On yachts this size, **ETO + AV/IT** critical for modern systems.
* Purser function becomes a **full-time admin role** above ~90m.
* Spa and medical are now standard expectation in 120m+ class.
