## Role summary

The Captain is the ultimate authority onboard. They are responsible for the safety of life, vessel, and reputation — while simultaneously delivering an effortless experience to owners and guests. They operate in public confidence and private uncertainty. They must appear in control even when information is incomplete, systems are unreliable, and crew are rotating beneath them.

They are not a department head. They are the convergence point of every department’s success or failure.

## Primary responsibility

Safe, compliant, and discreet operation of the yacht while meeting owner expectations.

If they fail: people get hurt, the yacht is detained, insurance is exposed, or the owner loses trust. Most failures begin as small unresolved truths that compound quietly.

## Daily reality

Their day is a sequence of interruptions.

* Morning briefing with heads of department
* Guest or owner requests
* Port agent coordination
* Flag state and compliance tasks
* Navigation and passage planning
* Crew issues
* Engineering escalations
* Budget and management queries

They constantly shift between:

* Strategic planning
* People management
* Safety oversight
* Guest-facing diplomacy
* Technical risk assessment

They rarely have full certainty. They must decide anyway.

Their internal questions are:

* Is the information I’m being given accurate?
* Is someone hiding a problem to avoid blame?
* Will this become visible to guests or owners?
* Is this decision defensible later?

## Decision horizon

Hours to months.

* Immediate: safety, navigation, guest requests
* Short-term: crew conflicts, maintenance scheduling
* Medium-term: seasonal planning, yard periods
* Long-term: reputation with owners and managers

They live in both reactive and strategic layers simultaneously.

## Driving factors

* Safety of life and vessel
* Owner trust and satisfaction
* Professional reputation
* Crew stability
* Avoiding public or regulatory incidents
* Delivering smooth guest experience regardless of backstage chaos

## Success metrics (real, informal)

* No safety incidents
* No regulatory detentions
* Guests feel everything “just works”
* Owner trusts their judgment without micromanaging
* Department heads bring problems early, not late
* Strong references for future commands

## What they value

* Early warning over perfect certainty
* Truthful reporting without spin
* Calm, concise information
* Cross-department visibility
* Evidence when making high-stakes calls
* Continuity across crew changes

## What they are often misinformed about

* Actual engineering risk state versus reported logs
* Whether maintenance is deferred for good reason or convenience
* Real crew fatigue and morale
* True inventory readiness
* Whether compliance records reflect reality or paperwork completion

## How legacy software fails them

* Requires navigating multiple modules to answer simple questions
* Assumes they have time to “check dashboards”
* Forces them to trust records they know are often performative
* Cannot summarise risk across departments
* Handover data is structured but meaning is lost. isolated and not uniformed.

## How Celeste should empower them

They should be able to ask:

* “What unresolved risks exist right now?”
* “What would keep the chief engineer awake tonight?”
* “Is anything overdue that affects safety or compliance?”
* “What changed since last week’s handover?”
* “Summarise guest-impacting issues”

Celeste should:

* Surface operational truth, not just logged data
* Highlight uncertainty or conflicting reports
* Provide narrative state, not lists
* Preserve memory across crew turnover
* Allow silent orientation without rituals

## Search behavior profile

Language is:

* Direct
* Outcome and risk focused
* Often non-technical
* Time-sensitive

Examples:

* “Anything I need to know before guests arrive?”
* “Why is this port clearance delayed?”
* “What did the last captain leave unresolved?”
* "summarise...."
* the want bigger picture items, nothing micro until click-on-demand info is executed. otherwise by department, days, grouping.

They search for:

* Risk
* Exceptions
* Summary of state
* Accountability trail

## Handover sensitivity

Extreme.

Captain handovers are where yachts lose memory.

Must persist:

* Deferred maintenance decisions and rationale
* Owner sensitivities and preferences
* Crew performance context
* Outstanding compliance items
* Known technical weak points

If lost, the new captain starts blind — and repeats history.
