## Role summary

The Engineer / Watchkeeper is the frontline operator of the yacht’s technical reality. They keep systems running hour by hour, respond to alarms before anyone else notices, and carry the quiet burden of being the first to know when something is wrong. They are judged not by reports, but by whether things keep working.

They live closest to the machinery and furthest from decision-makers.

## Primary responsibility

Monitor, operate, and maintain engineering systems during watch, escalating issues early and preventing small faults from becoming major failures.

If they fail: alarms are missed, minor faults cascade, equipment is damaged, or safety is compromised before senior engineers are aware.

## Daily reality

Their day is structured by watches, but rarely calm.

* Engine room rounds
* System checks
* Logging readings
* Responding to alarms
* Completing maintenance tasks
* Assisting contractors
* Cleaning and organisation
* Sudden call-outs from bridge or deck

They are interrupted constantly. They switch between:

* Routine checks
* Emergency response
* Paper or digital logging
* Hands-on repairs
* Being sent for tools or parts

Their private questions:

* Is this normal or the start of a bigger problem?
* Will I look incompetent if I escalate too early?
* Are the records I’m logging actually used?
* Did the last crew leave this in a safe state?
* Am i recording the logs correctly? is it time to record logs again?

## Decision horizon

Minutes to days.

* Immediate: alarm response
* Hourly: system trend observation
* Daily: task completion
* Short-term: identifying patterns for senior engineers

They are mostly reactive, with small opportunities for proactive insight.

## Driving factors

* Avoiding mistakes that cause damage
* Gaining trust of the chief engineer
* Proving competence for career progression
* Keeping systems stable
* Not being blamed for inherited problems

## Success metrics (real, informal)

* Alarms are handled smoothly
* Chief engineer isn’t surprised by faults
* Engine room remains clean and orderly
* Watch logs are accepted without question
* Erradicating known long-term adn short-term issues, resolving independtly and safely.

## What they value

* Clear guidance on priorities
* Easy access to manuals and diagrams
* Knowing system history
* Confidence that escalation is welcomed
* Tools that save time on logging
* One word, clarity.

## What they are often misinformed about

* Why certain jobs were deferred
* Real condition of equipment before they arrived
* Which readings matter versus noise
* Inventory accuracy
* Whether logs are reviewed or ignored

## How legacy software fails them

* Makes logging slow and repetitive
* Requires navigation to find manuals
* Splits fault history across modules
* Does not show context of previous failures
* Encourages box-ticking instead of thinking
* Punishes honesty when reporting problems

## How Celeste should empower them

They should be able to ask:

* “Has this alarm happened before?”
* “Show me the last maintenance for this system”
* “Where is the manual for this unit?”
* “Is this fault serious?”
* “What did the last engineer note?”

Celeste should:

* Make history instantly retrievable
* Link alarms to past outcomes
* Provide confidence levels
* Reduce logging friction
* Encourage early escalation, not hiding

## Search behavior profile

Language is:

* Short
* Technical
* Abbreviated
* Sometimes uncertain

Examples:

* “HT cooling temp rising”
* “Bilge alarm aft”
* “History of gen 1 shutdowns”
* “Manual for Alfa Laval separator”

They search for:

* Immediate technical answers
* Past fault context
* Instructions
* Confirmation of normal vs abnormal

## Handover sensitivity

High.

Watchkeeper handovers are fragile.

Must persist:

* Current running state
* Ongoing faults
* Temporary workarounds
* Systems being monitored closely
* Unusual noises, vibrations, trends

If lost, the next watch starts blind — and alarms become surprises.
