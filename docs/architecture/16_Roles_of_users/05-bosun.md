## Role summary

The Bosun is the deck department’s memory and muscle. They are the bridge between the deck officer's intent and the deckhands’ hands. They carry the unwritten knowledge of how this specific yacht actually behaves — not how the manuals claim it should.

They live in salt, sun, paint, ropes, and constant guest proximity. When something on deck goes wrong, everyone sees it.

## Primary responsibility

Execute and maintain safe, professional deck operations: navigation support, anchoring, mooring, exterior maintenance, and guest water activities.

If they fail: toy docking incidents, tender accidents, damaged paintwork, guest injuries, or reputational embarrassment.

## Daily reality

Their day is physical and reactive.

* team brief with deckhands, after their brief with dekc officers'.
* Morning washdowns
* Exterior inspections
* Tender prep
* Line handling
* Anchor operations
* Guest water sports
* Safety drills
* Repairing wear and tear
* Training new deckhands

They are constantly interrupted by:

* Guest requests
* Captain/Deck officer instructions
* Weather changes
* Port operations
* Deck Equipment failures (Cranes, toys, daily use items etc.)

Their internal questions:

* Are my deckhands actually competent or just pretending?
* Is this gear safe or held together with hope?
* Has this been serviced or just ticked off?
* Will this maneuver embarrass us in front of guests?
* Do I need to call engineers?
* Did they mean prot side or starboard side?

## Decision horizon

Minutes to days.

* Immediate: line handling, tender ops, safety calls, orgnaising decklhands via radio.
* Daily: task allocation and deck maintenance
* Short-term: readiness for passages and ports

They are highly reactive, with little strategic time.

## Driving factors

* Safety of crew and guests on deck
* Pride in clean, sharp presentation
* Seamless guest experience
* Avoiding visible mistakes
* Earning captain’s trust

## Success metrics (real, informal)

* No docking or mooring incidents
* Guests feel safe and cared for
* Exterior looks flawless
* Captain doesn’t need to micromanage
* Deck team works as a unit

## What they value

* Practical information
* Simple instructions
* Reliable equipment
* Knowing what’s planned next
* Deckhands who listen

## What they are often misinformed about

* Whether maintenance on deck equipment was actually done
* True condition of lines, winches, cranes
* Upcoming itinerary changes
* Guest preferences until last minute
* Inventory of deck spares

## How legacy software fails them

* Buries deck maintenance records deep in systems
* Requires office-style data entry they don’t have time for
* Stores manuals far from the job
* Doesn’t help during live operations
* Treats deck work like static checklists

## How Celeste should empower them

They should be able to ask:

* “When was this crane last serviced?”
* “Do we have spare mooring lines?”
* “Any deck safety issues open?”
* “Guest water toys status”
* “What did the last bosun warn about?”

Celeste should:

* Deliver answers hands-free, fast
* Link equipment to service history
* Preserve deck tribal knowledge
* Reduce paperwork after long days (handover, inventory, shopping etc.)
* Support decision-making during live ops

## Search behavior profile

Language is:

* Short
* Practical
* Equipment-based
* Sometimes informal
* illiterate, grammaitcally incorrect and mispelling.

Examples:

* “Anchor windlass service history”
* “Spare fenders location”
* “Jetski battery issues”
* “Passerelle fault”

They search for:

* Equipment status
* Immediate readiness
* Service history
* Safety info

## Handover sensitivity

High.

Bosun handovers lose deck knowledge fast.

Must persist:

* Temporary fixes on equipment
* Worn or unsafe gear
* Crew skill gaps
* Guest preferences for water ops
* Known quirks of cranes, doors, anchors
* Deckhand roles nad capaibiltiies within the team

If lost, deck incidents repeat.
