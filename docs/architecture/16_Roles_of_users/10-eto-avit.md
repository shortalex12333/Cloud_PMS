## Role summary

The ETO / AV-IT Officer is the electrical/electronic nervous system custodian of the yacht. They manage everything that moves information: navigation electronics, satellite communications, networks, CCTV, access control, guest entertainment, vessel monitoring systems, and increasingly hybrid automation layers. If it has electricity power source, its ETO job.

When systems fail, operations slow.
When networks fail, departments isolate.
When monitoring fails, engineers go blind.
When guest AV fails, reputation suffers.
Most importnatly, guest orientating role, therefore owner disatisfaction adn job-loss concequence from failure visible.

They operate in a space where failures are invisible until they suddenly aren’t.

## Primary responsibility

Maintain continuous operation of all electronic, networked, and control systems, ensuring reliable connectivity, monitoring, safety-critical instrumentation, and guest-facing technology.

If they fail: loss of navigation data, monitoring blind spots in engineering, communication outages, guest AV disruption, security vulnerabilities, and cascading failures across departments.

## Daily reality

Their day is diagnostic by default.

* Monitoring network health
* Maintaining satellite and shore connectivity
* Supporting bridge electronics
* Managing CCTV and access systems
* Fixing guest AV complaints
* Supporting engineering monitoring systems
* Updating firmware and software
* Chasing intermittent faults
* Explaining technical risk to non-technical officers

They are interrupted by:

* “The Wi-Fi is slow”
* “Radar froze”
* “The CCTV camera is black”
* “The monitoring screen is blank”
* “Guests can’t stream”

Their internal questions:

* Is this a real fault or user error?
* Is this a temporary glitch or a deeper system risk?
* Will this affect safety systems?
* Do I have remote support or spares for this?
* Has this happened before and how was it fixed?

## Decision horizon

Minutes to weeks.

* Immediate: outages and faults
* Daily: system stability and monitoring
* Weekly: preventative checks
* Seasonal: upgrades and refits

They operate mostly reactive, with strategic planning around refits.

## Driving factors

* System uptime
* Avoiding safety system failures
* Guest satisfaction with connectivity and AV
* Trust from captain and chief engineer
* Staying ahead of obscure, undocumented issues

## Success metrics (real, informal)

* No unplanned system outages
* No navigation or monitoring blind spots
* Guests rarely complain about tech
* Engineers trust their data feeds
* Captain never loses comms
* Problems fixed before they escalate

## What they value

* Accurate system diagrams
* Clean network topology
* Access to historical fault data
* Time to test before deploying changes
* Clear escalation paths with vendors

## What they are often misinformed about

* How critical certain systems truly are to safety
* Whether previous firmware updates were applied
* True wiring and network topology after years of modifications
* Whether spares exist for discontinued hardware
* How much the vessel relies on their systems until failure occurs

## How legacy software fails them

* Treats AV, IT, and electronics as side notes under “engineering”
* Stores manuals in inconsistent folders
* No unified fault history across systems
* No mapping between physical equipment and logical networks
* Requires manual documentation nobody maintains
* Handover loses topology knowledge

## How Celeste should empower them

They should be able to ask:

* “History of radar freezes”
* “Network topology for bridge systems”
* “Last firmware update on VSAT modem”
* “CCTV camera faults last season”
* “Which monitoring feeds does engineering rely on?”

Celeste should:

* Link physical equipment to logical systems
* Preserve topology and configuration memory
* Connect faults to fixes
* Allow fast retrieval of manuals and diagrams
* Highlight undocumented dependencies
* Expose uncertainty instead of hiding it

## Search behavior profile

Language is:

* Technical
* System-oriented
* Abbreviated
* Vendor-specific

Examples:

* “Furuno radar reboot loop”
* “Cisco switch config backup”
* “VSAT latency spikes”
* “PLC monitoring feed lost”

They search for:

* Fault history
* Configuration data
* Manuals and firmware
* Dependency mapping
* Prior fixes

## Handover sensitivity

Extreme.

ETO / AV-IT handovers are where yachts quietly become fragile.

Must persist:

* Network topology
* Custom wiring routes
* Firmware versions
* Temporary workarounds
* Known intermittent faults
* Vendor support contacts
* Password and access vaults locations. never true passwords (security risk). 

If lost, the next ETO is blind — and failures multiply fast.
