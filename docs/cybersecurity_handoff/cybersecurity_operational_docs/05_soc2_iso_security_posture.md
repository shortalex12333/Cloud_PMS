# SOC-2 / ISO Security Posture (Defensible Language)

## Architecture
Control-plane / data-plane separation with no customer data in auth systems.

## Access Control
Least-privilege, explicit memberships, yacht-scoped roles.

## Tenant Isolation
Multi-layer enforcement: application, database, storage.

## Audit & Monitoring
All security-relevant actions logged and reviewable.

## Incident Response
Immediate revocation and tenant-level containment supported.

## Encryption
TLS in transit, encryption at rest, tenant-key roadmap.
