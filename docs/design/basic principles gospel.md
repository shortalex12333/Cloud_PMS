Question every requirement: Do not accept a requirement just because it has always been done that way or because it came from a smart person or a specific department. Attach a person's name to each requirement and make the requirements "less dumb" by critically evaluating their necessity.
Delete any part or process step you can: Musk advocates for a strong bias toward subtraction. If you're not occasionally adding things back (around 10% of the time), you're likely not deleting enough processes or parts. The best part, according to Musk, is no part.
Simplify or optimize: Only after questioning and deleting unnecessary elements should you focus on simplifying and optimizing the remaining parts or processes. A common error is to optimize something that should not exist in the first place.
Accelerate cycle time: Once the process is simplified and optimized, the next step is to speed it up. This is about rapid iteration and moving faster, but only after the first three steps are rigorously applied.
Automate: The final step is to automate the process. Musk has noted that a major mistake he's made in the past is attempting to automate things too early in the process, which can lead to complex, automated versions of a flawed system. 


1. The intent engine must be near-perfect.

If it misfires, users will distrust the whole product.
You need tight action schemas, good guardrails, and proper confirmations.

2. You must avoid feature creep.

The moment you add:

dashboards

complex menus

modular navigation

…you kill your paradigm.

This must stay single-page, intent-first.
Or you become IDEA 2.0 — and nobody needs that.

3. AI must be woven into the workflow, not bolted on.

If it feels like “AI chat bolted to PMS data”, you lose.
Your agent needs deep integration with your database schema, micro-actions, file embeddings, and context cards.

4. Your UX discipline must be ruthless.

This product lives or dies by:

whitespace,

micro-interactions,

context stacks,

the Spotlight-like search layer,

and consistency.

If you allow clutter, you destroy everything.
