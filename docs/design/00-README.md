# Spotlight-style UX research pack (Markdown)

Generated: 2025-12-20

Purpose: a practical set of notes + summaries to help you recreate a **Spotlight-like command palette UX** (layout, “glass” material, focus behavior, search results model).

## What’s inside
- One `.md` file per key doc/article.
- Each file contains:
  - Link(s) to the original source
  - What the source is useful for (UI vs search/indexing vs materials)
  - Actionable takeaways for recreating the UX
  - Small, compliant quotes where helpful (kept short)

## Important limitations
Some Apple Developer Documentation and HIG pages are rendered client-side and couldn’t be fully fetched in this environment. For those pages, this pack includes:
- The canonical URL
- What the page covers (based on Apple’s preview snippet + related accessible references)
- Practical guidance + complementary sources that *are* accessible

## Suggested reading order
1. `01-spotlight-ux-architecture.md`
2. `06-nsvisualeffectview-reverse-engineering.md`
3. `07-nspanel-command-palette-window.md`
4. `08-wwdc25-liquid-glass-appkit.md`
5. Then dive into indexing/search (`03-app-search-programming-guide.md`, `04-core-spotlight-overview.md`)
