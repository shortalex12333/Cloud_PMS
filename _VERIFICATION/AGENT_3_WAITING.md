## What I Can Do Now

1. ✅ Read available verification file (create_work_order)
2. ✅ Extract preliminary gaps from 1 action
3. ✅ Set up pattern analysis framework
4. ⏳ Wait for remaining 4 verifications

## What I Need to Complete

- [ ] Read all 5 verification files
- [ ] Extract gaps from all 5 actions
- [ ] Apply pattern threshold (3/5 = 60%)
- [ ] Categorize by severity
- [ ] Design bulk fixes
- [ ] Create PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md
- [ ] Create AGENT_3_HANDOFF.md

## Preliminary Findings (1/5 actions)

**From verify_create_work_order.md:**

**Gaps found:**
1. Missing audit log (no pms_audit_log entry)
2. Priority/status mapping not documented
3. Missing 400 error test  
4. Missing RLS test

**Status:** ⚠️ Partial (4/6 proofs passed)

## Pattern Threshold Note

⚠️ **Cannot identify patterns yet**
- Pattern = 3+ actions affected (60%)
