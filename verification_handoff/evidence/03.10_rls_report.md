## Potential Issue: B007

**documents table allows anonymous SELECT**

Anonymous requests can read from the documents table without authentication.
This may be intentional (public documents) or a misconfigured RLS policy.

**Risk:** Low-Medium (metadata only, actual file content requires signed URL)
**Action Required:** Review documents table RLS policy in Supabase Dashboard
