PATTERN 3: Literal "placeholder" strings
Result: FOUND - see below

=== Placeholder Occurrences Found ===

1. apps/web/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts:15
   Context: SSR guard - creates dummy client during server-side rendering
   Code: supabaseInstance = createClient('https://placeholder.supabase.co', 'placeholder-key', {
   Risk: LOW - This is intentional SSR behavior, not data placeholder
   Note: Client is recreated with real values on client-side (see line 57)

2. apps/web/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts:83
   Context: Comment only - "// Helper function to get current user (placeholder)"
   Risk: NONE - Just a code comment

3. apps/web/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts:106
   Context: Comment only - "// Yacht signature validation (placeholder)"
   Risk: NONE - Just a code comment

4. apps/web/src/lib/microactions/confirmation.ts:44
   Context: Template variable replacement comment
   Code: "// Replace placeholders with context values"
   Risk: NONE - This is about UI text templating, not data IDs

5. apps/web/src/lib/supabase.ts:250
   Context: Comment about function implementation
   Risk: NONE - Just a code comment

=== CONCLUSION ===
No dangerous placeholder patterns found that would substitute fake yacht_id or user_id values.
The SSR placeholder is expected behavior and does not affect authenticated requests.
