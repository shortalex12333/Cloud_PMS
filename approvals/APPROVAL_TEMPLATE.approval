# Approval Template
#
# This file format is used for dangerous operations that require 3 signatures
# before implementation can proceed.
#
# Format (exactly 3 lines):
# Product: @github_handle YYYY-MM-DD
# Engineering: @github_handle YYYY-MM-DD
# Security: @github_handle YYYY-MM-DD
#
# Example:
# Product: @alice 2026-01-12
# Engineering: @bob 2026-01-12
# Security: @charlie 2026-01-12
#
# CI blocks implementation if:
# - This file does not exist
# - Any signature line is missing
# - Format is incorrect
#
# NO MEETINGS. NO EXCUSES. Just 3 lines.
