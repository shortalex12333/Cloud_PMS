# Plan 00-05: Remove "Email Integration is Off" Dead Code

## Objective

Find and remove ALL instances of "email integration is off" message from the codebase. This is dead code that should not exist per rules.md and CLAUDE.md.

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Search for all instances of "email integration" text (case insensitive):
```bash
grep -ri "email integration" apps/web/src/
grep -ri "email.*off" apps/web/src/
grep -ri "integration.*off" apps/web/src/
```
</task>

<task id="2">
For each file found:
- Read the file to understand context
- Remove the conditional block or component rendering this message
- If the message is in a component, remove the entire component if it serves no other purpose
- If part of a larger component, surgically remove just the email integration section
</task>

<task id="3">
Search for related constants or config:
```bash
grep -ri "EMAIL_INTEGRATION" apps/web/src/
grep -ri "emailEnabled" apps/web/src/
grep -ri "email_enabled" apps/web/src/
```
Remove any feature flags or config related to this dead feature.
</task>

<task id="4">
Verify removal is complete:
```bash
grep -ri "email integration" apps/web/src/
# Should return zero results
```
</task>

<task id="5">
Run build to ensure removal didn't break anything:
```bash
cd apps/web && npm run build
```
</task>

<task id="6">
Run existing tests to ensure no regressions:
```bash
cd apps/web && npm run test
```
</task>

## Verification

```bash
# Zero instances remain
grep -ri "email integration" apps/web/src/ | wc -l
# Should be 0

# Build passes
cd apps/web && npm run build

# No TypeScript errors about missing references
cd apps/web && npm run typecheck
```

## must_haves

- [ ] grep -ri "email integration" returns zero results
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] TypeScript check passes
- [ ] No broken imports from removed code
